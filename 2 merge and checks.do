// To do ----------------------------------------------------------------
// create the dataset BEFORE you start whittling it down for the graphs (do the
// lag vars for unemployment, govt rev, etc. as well)

// perhaps we want to include some of the shocks in the baker bloom paper? add
// **checks** at the end take a look at the labor - growth relationship in the
// literature?

// one concern about the use of fertility as an IV for number of workers 20-65
// is that it doesn't include immigrants *into* a country
// --------------------
// what does the literature say about growth regressions of this sort?

// --------------------
// --------------------
// And adding a bit more:
//
// Iâ€™m interested in looking at the impact of negative labor force growth on
// economies.  Pretty simple stuff at least to begin:
//
// Using the UN population data, find all 1 year periods where countries have
// experienced an absolute decline in their population aged 20-64. (A brief look
// suggests there are 203 historical cases at the country level).
//
// When did they happen (just a histogram by 1 year period)? How large the
// percentage drop in workers (*median* size by 1 year period)
//
// *median* size by 1 year period --> what do you mean here? get the median
// percent worker drop?
//
// What were economic growth rates during those 1 year periods compared to the
// (last) (ten year?) period before labor force growth was negative?
//
// What were economic growth rates during those 1 year periods compared to the
// global (and country income group) average growth?
// ---------------------------------------------
//
// What happened to government revenues and deficits during those periods
// compared to prior?
//
// What happened to interest rates and stock market returns?
//
// What happened to the unemployment rate total labor force participation and
// female labor force participation?
//
// Take out cases which overlap with a country being at war
// (https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets) and then take out low and lower
// middle income countries and see if that makes a difference.
//
// Look forward: according to the UN population forecasts, how many countries in
// each forthcoming 1 year period will see declining working age population? How
// large the percentage drop in workers (*median* size by 1 year period)
//
// â€œinstrumentâ€™ or just use the predicted change in working age population from
// ten years prior (e.g. us value for population aged 10-54 in 1980 as the value
// for population aged 20-64 in 1990) and/or try 20 year lag.
